# CredibleEdibles
by LipgLOSSisPoppin

Credible Edibles will take in an address or the userâ€™s location, as well as their preferences for prices/distance/ratings, and create a map of restaurants near them that match their input as closely as possible with the addresses and ratings of the restaurants listed below. The project would use the Yelp, Mapbox, and Google Maps APIs.
