Installed mapbox python module.
Right now, of the addresses that we get, we work with the first one. This could be changed in the future if it's a problem.
Renamed mapbox.py to geomapbox.py
Finished geocode(address) which takes an address string input and returns a list containing coordinates

Fixed the jinja rendering so quotes are rendered. Map finally loads in results.html, using test center, but still doesn't add features. Need to add back to homepage button, fix the size of the map.

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 9:28

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 9:28
Added more styling, but it's not showing up right now, perhaps CSS caching issues.
