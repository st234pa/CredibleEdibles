st234pa -- 2016-12-06 2:55
Fixed stylesheet links.

P0rkins -- 2016-12-06 12:36
Installed mapbox python module.
Right now, of the addresses that we get, we work with the first one. This could be changed in the future if it's a problem.
Renamed mapbox.py to geomapbox.py
Finished geocode(address) which takes an address string input and returns a list containing coordinates

ogal7 -- 2016-12-07 12:45
Got rauth to work, yelp.py successfully loads json object when given coordinates

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 12:52
Got rid of price level in homepage.html, app.py.

P0rkins -- 2016-12-07 1:03

skabir8 -- 2016-12-07 2:52
Changed up how the rating and distance worked in app.py
fixed up results.html. used jinja to show the list of things near you with title and location
Attempted to fix mapbox, but theres a conflict in the stylesheets

P0rkins -- 2016-12-07 2:37
Switching to python geolocation, gmaps wasn't working
nvm finished locate with googledocs. googlemaps.py done


st234pa -- 2016-12-07 2:55
Fixed the jinja rendering so quotes are rendered. Map finally loads in results.html, using test center, but still doesn't add features. Need to add back to homepage button, fix the size of the map. 

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 9:04
Fixed the import utils.yelp statement in app.py. Test data now works!!

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 9:28
Got rid of the bkgd image, it was being troublesome and uggo. More styling to come though. Also fixed some sizing for the map.

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 9:28
Added more styling, but it's not showing up right now, perhaps CSS caching issues.

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 9:59
Found, fixed typos in style.css!

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 10:13
Added Lobster and Raleway from fonts.googleapis.com. Centered the form and the results list.

st234pa -- 2016-12-07 11:13
Fixed radio buttons in homepage.html. getRating(), getAddress(), and getDistance() need to be adjusted. Got rid of test center loc.

ogal7 -- 2016-12-08 12:33
Tweaked files in rauth directory so import rauth would work in yelp.py

skabir8 -- 2016-12-08 2:03
Changed homepage so radiobuttons would have values. Changed code in app.py to compensate for this

skabir8 -- 2016-12-08 2:48
Fixed issue with mapbox geo code. Custom address now works and renders results correctly.

st234pa -- 2016-12-08 4:47
Added the ratings to the results.html list. Note that we can't use requests, so we need to fix geomapbox and googlemaps. Added a back to home button in results.html.

st234pa -- 2016-12-08 4:56
Added /homepage/ route to app.py, hopefully back to home works. 

st234pa -- 2016-12-08 4:59
Actually, changed form action to "/" in results.html

ogal7 -- 2016-12-08 9:47
Unpublicized keys

st234pa -- 2016-12-08 11:22
Actually, Olivia only unpublicized the yelp keys. Lorenz needs to do that for googlemaps and geomapbox. I replaced the form with submit button for the back to home in results with an href. Still need to style.

st234pa -- 2016-12-08 11:30
Got rid of mapboxgl.accessToken in JS from results.html. Added btn class to Back to home.

st234pa -- 2016-12-09 2:32

st234pa - 2016-12-09 10:48
Added mapbox_accessToken as a variable to results.html, which app.py has to set and pass.

st234pa - 2016-12-09 11:16
Wrote key.py to create a dictionary of keys/tokens and stuff of that nature. Other python files should import key so they can create that dictionary.

st234pa - 2016-12-09 11:29
Updated key.py so that getkeydict() opens keys.txt correctly, because keys.txt is in the root dir.

P0rkins -- 2016-12-09 11:38
changed from requests to urllib2 in geomapbox.py and googlemaps.py

st234pa - 2016-12-09 11:45
Fixed key.py to get rid of newlines in the keys.

st234pa - 2016-12-09 11:52

P0rkins - 2016-12-10 12:06
Removed API keys from geomapbox and googlemaps. now relies on key.py

Moved key.py to root, hopefully this works.

ogal7 - 2016-12-10 4:42
linked yelp.py to key.py so it could read from keys.txt

st234pa - 2016-12-11 6:41
Added a getToken() function to geomapbox.py, added mapbox_accessToken as a variable to pass when rendering results.html. Also deleted import requests in googlemaps.py because it doesn't need it anymore!

st234pa - 2016-12-12 2:26
Added .encode('utf-8') to str(key) in yelp.py. Changed str() to unicode()
